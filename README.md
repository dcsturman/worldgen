# Worldgen - A Traveller Solar System Generator

Worldgen is a web application for generating Traveller solar systems and supporting materials for those systems.  It takes a world name and a UWP for the main world and can generate either or both of the following:

1. A full solar system with the main world at the center and up to two companion stars.  The system will include all worlds and gas giants generated by the Traveller rules, as well as any satellites of those worlds and any planetary data.
2. A trade table of available goods for the main world.

The entire system is written in Rust using Leptos as a reactive, front end framework.  Leptos embeds HTML and CSS directly in the Rust code.

To run the application, you will need to have Rust and Cargo installed, the wasm32-unknown-unknown target for Rust, and Trunk.

1. To install Rust and Cargo see [this link](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. Install the wasm32-unknown-unknown target for Rust.

   ```bash
   rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
   ```

3. Install Trunk.

   ```bash
   cargo install trunk
   ```

Now you can run worldgen:

```bash
trunk serve --open
```

This will open a browser window with the application running.
